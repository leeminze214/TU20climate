     <div id="Description">
      JRL (Jaden, Ren Jie and Lee) is a team of three high school students
      who are motivated to learn more about business and technology.
      Over the course of the last two months, we have worked together to come up with a product focused on this yearâ€™s topic,
      climate change. After weeks of hard work, our team has created Envite, a tool that provides access to relevant
      information on climate change, various charity organizations, and ways in which our users can help save the environment.
      Envite is a website with a variety of news articles, videos, and charities, which will help our users learn how they can
      become informed and contribute towards solving the issues affecting our planet.
